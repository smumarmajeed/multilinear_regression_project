# multilinear_regression_project
ðŸ“Š Multi-Linear Regression Web App
This Multi-Linear Regression Web Application is a full-stack project built using Flask (Python), HTML, CSS, JavaScript . It allows users to perform multi-linear regression by entering multiple independent variables and calculates the predicted dependent variable along with a detailed step-by-step solution and a visual graph.

Developed as part of a Data Structures and Algorithms course, this project showcases how core DSA concepts and statistical modeling can be applied in real-world data science applications.

ðŸŽ¯ Features
âž• Input multiple independent variables (X) and corresponding dependent variable (Y) data

ðŸ“ˆ Calculate the multi-linear regression equation:
Y = b0 + b1*X1 + b2*X2 + ... + bn*Xn

ðŸ§® Display detailed step-by-step calculations (sums, means, coefficients)

ðŸ“Š Plot the input data and resulting regression line using real-time graph

ðŸ’¾ Save inputs and results in SQL Server for future reference

ðŸ§  Data Structures Used
Array/List â€“ To store and process variable values

Matrix/2D Array â€“ For regression coefficient calculations

Hash Table â€“ For storing and retrieving saved user inputs

Dynamic input generation â€“ Based on the number of X variables selected

ðŸ’» Tech Stack
Backend: Python (Flask Framework)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript!

Graphing Library: Matplotlib / Chart.js (for data visualization)
